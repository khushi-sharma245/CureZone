        <h1>Acetaminophen</h1>
        <p>Acetaminophen is often used to treat mild to moderate pain. Acetaminophen is safe for most people to take and side effects are rare. You can buy most types of acetaminophen from supermarkets or pharmacies. Some types are only available on prescription.</p>

        <h2>What is acetaminophen used for?</h2>
        <p>Acetaminophen can be used to treat pain, including:
        <ul>
            <li>headaches</li>
            <li>toothache</li>
            <li>sprains</li>
        </ul>
        It can also reduce fevers caused by illnesses like colds and flu.</p>

        <h2>Types of acetaminophen</h2>
        <p>Acetaminophen is available as:
        <ul>
            <li>tablets or caplets</li>
            <li>capsules</li>
            <li>liquid – usually for children</li>
            <li>soluble tablets (tablets that dissolve in water to make a drink)</li>
            <li>suppositories (capsules inserted into the back passage)</li>
            <li>an injection given into a vein – normally only used in hospital</li>
        </ul>
        In some products, acetaminophen is combined with other ingredients. This includes cold and flu remedies or certain combination painkillers. It may be sold under the name acetaminophen or under a brand name (which may also contain other ingredients).</p>

        <h2>How to take acetaminophen</h2>
        <p>How much acetaminophen you can take depends on:
        <ul>
            <li>your age</li>
            <li>your weight</li>
            <li>the type of acetaminophen you’re taking</li>
            <li>how strong the acetaminophen is</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Adults</h2>
        <p>Adults can usually take 1 or 2 tablets (500mg) every 4 to 6 hours. They shouldn’t take more than 4g (8x 500mg tablets) in the space of 24 hours. Always read the instructions that come with your medicine because dosage and strength of the tablet can vary. Acetaminophen should start to work within an hour. The effect usually lasts several hours. Don’t take more than the recommended dose if it isn’t relieving your symptoms. Adults can take ibuprofen with acetaminophen if necessary.</p>

        <h2>Children</h2>
        <p>Children under 16 need to take a lower dose of acetaminophen depending on their age or weight. Check the packet or leaflet, or ask a pharmacist or doctor for advice. Acetaminophen is usually given to very young children using a measuring spoon or an oral syringe.</p>

        <h2>Possible side effects</h2>
        <p>Side effects from acetaminophen are rare but can include:
        <ul>
            <li>an allergic reaction – this can cause a rash and swelling</li>
            <li>flushing</li>
            <li>low blood pressure</li>
            <li>a fast heartbeat</li>
            <li>blood disorders</li>
            <li>liver and kidney damage, if you take too much (overdose) – this can be fatal in severe cases</li>
            <li>Speak to a pharmacist or doctor if you develop any worrying side effects that you think could be caused by acetaminophen.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Reporting side effects</h2>
        <p>The Yellow Card Scheme allows you to report side effects from any type of medicine you’re taking. It’s run by a medicines safety watchdog called the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).</p>

        <h2>Warnings and precautions</h2>
        <p>Most people can take acetaminophen safely, including:
        <ul>
            <li>pregnant women</li>
            <li>breastfeeding women</li>
            <li>children over 2 months of age – lower doses are recommended for young children</li>
        </ul>
        Read the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine. You should discuss any concerns or queries with your pharmacist or GP. Always get advice before taking acetaminophen if you:

            <li>have liver or kidney problems</li>
            <li>have problems with alcohol, like long-term alcohol misuse</li>

        </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Other medicines and acetaminophen</h2>
        <p>It may not be safe to take acetaminophen at the same time as:
        <ul>
            <li>other products containing acetaminophen</li>
            <li>carbamazepine – used to treat epilepsy and some types of pain</li>
            <li>colestyramine – used to reduce itchiness caused by primary biliary cirrhosis (a type of liver disease)</li>
            <li>imatinib and busulfan – used to treat certain types of cancer</li>
            <li>ketoconazole – a type of antifungal medicine</li>
            <li>lixisenatide – used to treat type 2 diabetes</li>

            <li>warfarin – used to prevent blood clots</li>
            Check the leaflet that comes with your medicine to see if it can be taken with acetaminophen. Ask a pharmacist or doctor if you’re not sure.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Acetaminophen overdose</h2>
        <p>Taking too much acetaminophen can be very dangerous. This is known as an overdose. After taking too much acetaminophen, some people:
        <ul>
            <li>feel sick</li>
            <li>vomit</li>
            <li>have abdominal (tummy) pain</li>
            <li>Often there are no obvious symptoms at first.</li>
        </ul>
        You should speak to a pharmacist or GP practice if you have taken more than the recommended dose of acetaminophen and are feeling unwell. Phone 111 if your GP practice or pharmacy are closed.</p>
